/*
  MSFT question

  given a circular linked list, sorted in ascending order, insert a new node

  solution: given the entry node, create a new one right after (as the old entry) and then float the node 
  left/right accordingly.

  new node x is in the right position if:
  a <= x <= b
  a <= x > b, where b < a (this means that it wraps around).
  if x would float into its original position, quit out (we've come full circle).
 */

class Node {
  int value;
  Node* next;

  Node(int _value) : value(_value) {}
  Node(int* _values, int size) {
    Node* tmp = this;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      this->value = *values;
      
    }
  }
};
